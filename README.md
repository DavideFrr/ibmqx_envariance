# IBMQX_Experiments
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate entanglement assisted invariance,
also known as envariance, and parity learning,
using IBM QX series quantum computers.
Here you will find not only the code needed to run the experiments yourself,
but also the results of ours
(in case you don't have the time or patience and just want to see the data).

## Requirements

In order to run the experiments or just work with this repository you'll need to setup
the QISKit sdk, detailed instructions cn be found
[here](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/blob/master/doc/install.rst#3.1-Setup-the-environment).

You'll also need to register on [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/community)
in order to receive your API Token (a key to grant you access to IBM QX quantum computers)
and have at least 5 credits on that account.
